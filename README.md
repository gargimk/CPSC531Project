# CPSC531Project

In this Project we are mining the Yelp Dataset to classify the reviews as positive or negative depending on the review start. 
The algorithm used in this project is SVM (Support Vector Machine) to classify reviews as positive or negative. 
The SVM classifier is implemented in Python (using libraries NLTK, SCIKIT learn) and the results are compared with its Weka Tool counterpart.
